# Battleships

This game is rather simple. Enter your coordinates and see if you hit the enemy ship. Sink a ship when all squares are hit. For this particular game you play the computer. Each player takes turns to eliminate each other. When a player eliminates all of the oppositions ships, that player wins. 

The current design offers 2 x Destroyers and 1 x Battleships. This game can be easily modified to operate the fully fledged version of the game if desired.

This game offers a cheat mode whereby you can see the computer ship locations on a grid by typing 'cheat' where you enter your target coordinates
